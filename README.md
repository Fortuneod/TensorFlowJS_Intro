# TensorFlowJS_Intro
Basic Introduction to TensorFlow using TensorFlow.js

The purpose of this is to introduce newbies to TensorFlow

Most commonly, TensorFlow applications are implemented using the Python Language. However, for the simple example we will be looking at today, we will work with JavaScript. This is due to a number of complexities associated with working with Python (that may put off beginners) whereas it can be easily done in JavaScript without any stress. This is made possible using TensorFlow.js

Two very simple Applications are created here. The first is a simple TensorFlow Prediction Application (index.html), the second looks at how TensorFlow can check for best fits and draw a curve on a graph. This works with Chart.js

There is also a comparison between working with just javascript(default.html) and using TensorFlow.js
